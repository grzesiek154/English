# Don't, doesn't, not to

https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/123961/what-is-the-difference-between-doesnt-dont-and-not-to#:~:text=1)%20that%20don't%20is,only%20used%20about%20personal%20resolutions.

That **don't** is only used for advising or suggesting. 2) That **doesn't** is only used for describing behaviour and habits. 3) That **not to** is only used about personal resolutions

**Main verbs**

If you want to negate the main verb and there is already an auxiliary verb (be, have, will, should could, must) in front of it, you insert **not** between the auxiliary and main verbs.

> I am **not** going to the party
> I have **not** seen him today
> I will **not** have time tomorrow
> You must **not** tell anybody about this

If the verb that you want to negate is **be**, just add **not** after it.

> Dinner is ready
> Dinner is **not** ready

The main verbs **need** and **dare** are special cases: in the positive, it is followed by **to**, and in the negative **to** is replaced by **not**.

> You need to come
> You need **not** come

For all other main verbs that don't have an auxiliary verb, you add the auxiliary verb **do** and then negate the auxiliary verb. The auxiliary verb has two cases: **does** for third person singular (he/she/it) and **do** for everything else. When negated, this can be written out in full **do not, does not**, or contracted **don't, doesn't**.

> I want to go to the party
> I **don't** want to go to the party



------

**non-main verbs**

If the verb that you want to negate is not the main verb and it's preceded by **to**, it's an infinitive: you negate it by putting **not** before the **to**

> I told him to come
> I told him **not** to come

Likewise, if the verb you want to negate is not the main verb and it's got an '-ing' ending, then you negate it by putting **not** before the verb.

> thinking can get you into trouble
> **not** thinking can get you into trouble
